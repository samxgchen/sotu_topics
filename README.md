Presidents used to discuss war more directly in SOTU speeches. Madison's 1814 speech during the War of 182 had the highest proportion of 'war' mentions. He reports directly on different arenas of the conflict. For example: "In the recent attempt of the enemy on the city of Baltimore, defended by militia and volunteers, aided by a small body of regulars and sea men, he was received with a spirit which produced a rapid retreat to his ships, whilst concurrent attack by a large fleet was successfully resisted by the steady and well-directed fire of the fort and batteries opposed to it."
